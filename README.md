# Book Digests

This repository holds a number of Markdown text files which represent my personal digests and notes for a number of technical books.

These digests are not meant to replace the books, but rather to complement them and act as memory aids.  Read the book, then occasionally re-read the digest notes to refresh your memory of the book.  All digest notes are broken down per chapter of the original book so it's easy to find the section you might need to re-read from the original book if reading the digest notes makes you realise there's something you've forgotten.

Improvements via suggestions and/or pull requests are welcome, especially in the area of making the digests more succinct (i.e. focus on taking things away rather than adding them).
