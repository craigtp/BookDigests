## Chapter 1 - Good Rebels, Great Work
* There can be “good” rebels in the workplace and there can be “bad” rebels.
* Good rebels are optimistic rather than pessimistic, will create rather than complain are driven by passion not anger and will looks for solutions that are inclusive of co-workers and which benefit the organisation as a whole.
* Good rebels care deeply about their organisation and strive to make change which improves both their organisation and their co-workers, but the changes do not need to be huge organisation-wide changes, they can be small localised changes.
* Good rebels align their ideas with the organization's goals, they tap into the brilliance of others respecting them at all times, they use conflict productively, judge ideas not people and know when to walk away.
* Most organisations have what’s known as an “Organizational Silence”.  This is that organizations may verbalize openness to new ideas, however most organizational cultures send implicit and sometimes explicit signals to employees that they should remain silent about their concerns.

## Chapter 2 - What makes me a rebel at work?
* If you’re ever curious that there may be a better way of accomplishing some aspect of the work, isn’t afraid to point out the “elephant-in-the-room” and offer ways to remove it, and pays attention to emerging trends and how they may improve your organisation, then you’re almost certainly a “rebel”.
* Most rebels are not “made” but rather are “born” as a rebel.  One learns, however, how to be a good rebel rather than a bad one.
* You are not a rebel when you first voice an opinion different that the prevailing orthodoxy of the organisation, you become a rebel when you continue to speaking up despite the costs.
* Three common rebel tendencies are: They are future thinkers, they tend to work ahead and they come from a different background or culture and think differently.
* Some rebels can be “accidental rebels” - thrust into a position by their boss or company which is inherently “rebel” (i.e. a “champion” for corporate social responsibility).

## Chapter 3 - Gaining Credibility
* In order to be an effective rebel, you need to gain lots of credibility.  Often more than other non-rebel colleagues.
* In order to gain credibility, you need to understand your boss - What would they like to be able to achieve? What obstacles do they face? What are they afraid of?
* Frequently, bosses fear change as change brings risk and uncertainty.  You need to always be open about risks, how you would research and manage risk.  You need to be candid about what is uncertain or unknowable and how this can be best mitigated.
* Do not confuse risk with uncertainty.  Risks are known and can be managed.  Uncertainty, by definition, is unknown but steps can be taken to ensure that as the unknown becomes known, it doesn’t negatively impact the organisation.
* Always treat your boss with complete respect.  Never criticise your boss, even privately to other people. It will always find it’s way back to them.
* Never go over your boss’s head.  The chances of it working are very slim, and worse, once you do it, you’ve shown that you’re effectively untrustworthy which destroys credibility.
* Don’t worry about your boss stealing your idea.  Even if this happens, it’s effectively a win for you too as the boss will now back your idea for positive change as if it’s their own.
* Be aware of some of the language your boss may use around you ideas you’ve pitched to them.  Things like: “Does Jack know about this?” Could mean that the idea is so good, your boss wants to be the one to discuss it with Jack or it could mean that your boss thinks the idea so terrible that he wants to ensure Jack never hears of it!  Also, when a manager says, “I appreciate all the work and thought you’ve put into this.” It often means the exact opposite - “Forget about it!”
* You ideally need to build a rebel alliance - it’s difficult to evoke change on your own, so make sure to include as many people as you can in your ideas - invite others to a lunch meeting or set up some communal area on a corporate intranet where ideas can be openly discussed, or find an existing alliance - perhaps a local meetup group.
* You need to increase your trustworthiness as a rebel.  In order to do this, you must ensure you support your colleagues on every level and never let them down.  This may mean working hard inside the very  system you’re trying to change but nothing undercuts a rebel more quickly than letting your colleagues down.
* Build trust by: always doing what you say you’ll do, being genuinely committed to helping the organisation success, helping your colleagues whilst expecting nothing in return, admitting mistakes and providing early warnings when things are unlikely to go as planned, being respectful of others.

## Chapter 4 - Navigating the Organisational Landscape
* Before being able to change things for the better, you must first really understand how the organisation currently works.  The place to start for this is knowing what the organisation values.
* To understand what’s most valued, ask yourself questions like: “ Is this a mission-centric or customer-centric organization? Or is it a support organization that is most concerned with keeping the hierarchy around it happy and satisfied?”, “ What kinds of ideas do people pay attention to and what is usually dismissed?” & “Has the organization endured a recent trauma that is leading everyone to play it safe, or alternatively, has a new leader taken over who is encouraging bold ideas?”
* Understand how decisions are made.  Is the organization democratic in its processes and does it value consensus? Or is there a strong executive who makes decisions? Does it have many independent power centers or is there more of a traditional hierarchy? Who influences whom?
* By mindful of the “rhythm” of your organisation.  Often, you’ll need to time your idea pitches for when planning and budgets meetings are mostly held in order to ensure your ideas are not “put on hold” until the next fiscal year.
* Pay attention to how resources are allocated to new projects.  If your organisation has a structured approach to investment, this can be either a good or bad thing.  Good that the organisation at least recognizes the need to refresh its processes on a regular basis, but bad because the investment can  become political with favoured executives getting the funding first.
* To best understand the “landscape” you need to know why people will say “no”.  One of the best ways to understand this is to use the “five whys” (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) technique.
* All change affects people, therefore, it’s important to understand the perspectives of all other people who would be impacted by any change and to take their perspectives into account. Ask yourself the following questions to understand things from other people’s perspectives.  “What are they accountable for?”, “What are their motivations?”, “What does success look like to them?”, “What happens if they make a mistake?”
* You must build relationships with people who will both help you and who will hinder you as a rebel.  This includes BBB’s (Bureaucratic black belts) - these are people who have mastered their organization’s rules and culture and whose primary motivations appear to be making sure that the organization’s rules are followed and operational integrity is maintained.  Also be aware of “Benevolent bureaucrats” - these people aren’t out to stop you, but will slow you down as they insist upon being a part of the change.  Also be very aware of “Wind Surfers” - they are BBB’s with very strong personal ambitions and wish to ascend the hierarchy, often at your expense.
* Avoid falling into organisational traps by always saying thank you to people for their time and input and  don’t improvise or “wing it” when presenting ideas in meetings, especially to people whom you really need on your side.

## Chapter 5 - Communicating your Ideas
* When communicating your ideas, you should follow should standard rules to ensure that your ideas will be well received based upon who you are pitching your ideas to.
* Show what’s at stake and how your idea relates to the people to whom you’re pitching.  Ensure you focus on the why the idea matter rather than how it will be achieved.
* Paint a picture of what could be and make the current status quo unappealing.  Be specific in how your ideas will improve people’s well-being and help them feel a new way of doing things evoking an emotional response.
* Show that the idea can really work.  Avoid going into too much detail, but highlight how your idea bridges a gap between where the organisation currently is and where it could be in the future.
* Be positive and pithy.  Use visual cues when presenting your idea (i.e. a tightrope walker for something precarious etc.) but don’t labour your points and always stop to hear feedback.
* Build support.  The way to bring an idea to life is by helping people see the value in the idea for them and asking them to be part of the effort. Be aware of the “10 percent rule” - It often only take 10% of people in an organisation to support an idea in order for it to be implemented.
* Gauge reaction to your ideas and ensure you have buy-in before proceeding.  Ensure the idea is clear to those you’re presenting it to and that the issue your idea addresses is important enough to them.
* If no one thinks your idea is valuable, it’s probably time to either refine the idea or to drop it completely. If you do have supporters, your idea may be viable but you may need to navigate controversy and conflict in order to bring it to fruition.

## Chapter 6 - Managing Conflict
* There can be no change without conflict.  Great outcomes always involve some kind of controversy.
* There are 3 types of conflict in the workplace:  Interpersonal, Structural and Values-based.  Interpersonal is when two people simply don’t get along and will never see eye to eye.  Structural is where two departments disagree on a strategy or tactic due to it being better for one department over the other.  Values-based is the most serious, and is simply where your values are so diametrically opposed to those of the organisation.  In this case, your chance of success as a rebel is almost non-existent.
* Understand your organization to be able to make change. Create change but don’t try to change your organization.
* Conflict comes in 3 stages:  disagreement, controversy and conflict.  Disagreements come when talking about new ideas.  Controversy comes when considering new ideas and conflict comes when fighting about new ideas.
* So how can we disagree without being disagreeable?  Listen before jumping in, speak last, remember that it’s not about winning and take out the emotion (i.e. say things like “Here’s what I’ve observed…” rather than “I think that….”). 
* Keep the conversation positive and focus on possibilities and collaboration by asking things like “How might we….”  Avoid “why” questions as these can make people feel defensive.
* When engaging in controversy, you’ll be most successful if you stand up for structural ideas that support the organization's core goals and values. You should show (not tell!) what’s at stake by painting a realistic picture of how things could be and that your ideas can work.
* Keep meetings focused on vision.   Follow: Vision, Planning, Detail, Problem, Drama.
* Be aware of superiors that want to “build consensus” for your idea first.  That’s a stalling tactic to avoid making decisions.
* During conflict, be careful about “reading the riot act” to your boss/organisation.  This is often a last resort and if it doesn’t work, there may be no way back for you.  When angry, don’t make personal attacks, always try to see the other person’s side, acknowledge the disagreement and remember it’s not about being right.

## Chapter 7- Dealing with Fear, Uncertainty & Doubt
* We must learn to control and deal with our emotions.  This is one of the most important traits of the successful rebel.
* There are many fears that can hold you back and paralyze you.  The biggest fear is that of losing your job, however, the biggest reasons people lose their jobs is dishonesty, poor performance and inability to work with others.  Very rarely is it, “refusing to follow direction and orders”.
* Other fears are hurting our chances of being promoted, upsetting our boss or hurting our reputation.    Whilst these are legitimate fears, it’s often easier with a supportive boss and one whom we can understand to know what may upset them. It’s also important to show positive results as fast as you can, and ensure that you support the “bottom line” or whatever results count.
* In private industry, the most important indicator of whether you’ll get promoted is how directly you influence revenue. If you’re a rebel and you’re consistently bringing in revenue, the organization is more likely to want to keep and possibly promote you, even if they dislike your rebel ways.
* Remember that everything you say and do will be seen and evaluated in the context of everything else you’ve said and done. Work on building a positive reputation, which makes for positive context.  Build relationships and trust.
* If you’re challenged to present your idea to very senior executives, remember that senior leaders will want to cut to the chase.  Address these important questions:  How does this help us achieve our important goals?  Is is feasible?  What are the risks?  What kind of resources will it take and is the investment worth the outcome?
* Remember that fear is specific, but doubt is more vague.  What often stops us is not fear, as fears being more specific can be tackled, but doubt.  Know your strengths and lean on them.  Identify your “give up” line, which is the thing you mutter under your breath when you’re at the end of your rope, and get this under control.
* Be ready to change your environment or to take a break from everything in order to clear your mind and cleanse your assumptions - re-evaluate your own ideas to ensure they’re still relevant and useful.

## Chapter 8 - A Guide To Rebel Self-Care
* Heed the warning signs of burnout.   Don’t let your work and your “rebel idea” consume you to the point where you see everything through the lens of that idea, and don’t let your focus cause you to lose sight of the biggest asset the rebel can have, other people.
* Remember the Three R’s of Rebel self-care:  Retreat, Reset & Resilience.   Be prepared to retreat from the idea if you’re going nowhere with it fast.  Reset your perspectives by re-evaluating your goals and situation to gain clarity on the next steps.  Restore your resiliency by incorporating new, positive habits into your life inside and outside of work to help restore a positive and balanced mind-set, lean on your biggest strengths and try to find new friends and supporters of your ideas in work.
* Know when to quit.  Sometimes, it may just be time to leave your organisation if there’s no chance that your idea could ever work there.  Some signs that it’s time to leave are
   * Your values are irreconcilable with those of the organization.
   * Your organization is resisting important industry or professional trends. By staying with the organization, you won’t keep pace with trends.
   * You have been negatively labeled and are being assigned to projects out of the mainstream mission of the organization, limiting opportunities for growth and learning.
   * Frustration and anger have led you to say or do some deeply hurtful things to people, which will be hard to recover from.
   * All your mentors and bosses you could work with have left the organization or been assigned far away from your chain of command. You are isolated and unprotected.
   * After years of turbulence and attempts at reform, your leadership announces a “back to basics” campaign. The organization has sounded retreat. It will probably be years before the organization is ready to move forward again.
* Some good questions to ask a potential new boss during an interview when evaluating openness to change and acceptance of “rebel” behaviour are:
   * What is the organization trying to achieve? How do you measure success?
This question reveals whether a clear organizational purpose exists. When there is a clear purpose, rebels have a much easier time because they can link their ideas to the big organizational goal or purpose.
   * What’s possible that hasn’t yet been done in this [field | company | organization]? What are the greatest opportunities for the organization?
This question helps you gauge whether the interviewer is a forward-thinking idea person.
   * What do you especially like about this organization’s culture and work environment?
The answer to this question may reveal whether the person is positive and appreciative of the strengths of the organization, but be sure to sanity-check the answer to this question with other signals from the interview).
   * What’s the best assignment/project you’ve ever worked on? What made it so fulfilling?
Does the interviewer enjoy implementation or creating new things? Rebels tend to do better working for a boss who likes creating new things.
   * How do you deal with failure?
If the organization values experimentation and new ideas, a conversation about failure will be engaging, positive, and specific. If, however, the person hesitates and gives bland, trite answers like “We learn from our failures,” dig a little deeper to gauge how comfortable the person really is talking about failure.
   * How do you support people who question approaches that may no longer be effective and who see alternative ways of doing things?
How a person answers this question is more telling than the words themselves. Is the person comfortable with the question? Does the answer flow easily and naturally—or does it take a bit to find the words? Does it sound like the person truly values truth-telling idea people? Or do you detect some annoyance? Does the response indicate that people regularly bring up ideas and the boss has a genuine and comfortable way to support those people and ideas?
* When evaluating a potential new job, always walk around and look at the work environment as this can be very telling. Is there a positive buzz about the place or is it more of a hushed, disengaged feeling?

## Chapter 9 - Am I Becoming A Bad Rebel?
* Be mindful of the “rebel arc”.  If flows from left to right like this:
Observation > Concern > Idea > Proposal > Advocacy > Obsession > Negativity > Cynicism > Irrelevance
* You need to stay to the left of “Obsession” on the arc.  Moving to the right of this may be bad rebel behaviour and will have a negative impact, not a positive impact.
* Very occasionally, it may be the right thing to do some “bad” rebel behaviour and bulldoze through your change agenda.  This is most likely correct when you have a very limited time in the job in which to implement your ideas.
* To stay a “good” rebel, always play within the rules of your organisation and don’t try to circumvent the rules or “go around” process.
* Always keep your sense of humour.  It’s an important self-defence mechanism, and can win your more supporters.  No one like a miserable rebel!
* Be an idea carrier, not an idea warrior, and don’t play the “hero”, determined to save the organisation from itself.  Don’t see yourself as the “owner” of new ideas, determined to force them through at all costs.  Float the ideas, advocate them, but let others pick it up and run with it also.

## Chapter 10 - Give This Chapter To Your Boss
* Rebels are not enemies or troublemakers.  They could be your most valuable employee, identifying risks, solving problems and creating better ways to work.
* Company leaders talk more than ever today about innovation and being more creative in how we work so that work can be performed better and faster.  Today’s younger generation of workers are frequently “intrinsic” rebels who see it as their duty to improve the workplace.
* It’s incorrect to think that rebels want to change everything or that they thrive on always rocking the boat.  They’re happy to leave what works, and only want to improve what isn’t working or can be improved by eliminating bureaucratic rules and business practices.
* Good rebels are not “yes people”.  As a boss, you may appreciate the rebel’s ideas, but don’t really want to deal with what’s needed to change.
* As a boss, you need to create the right work environment for a rebel.  Be very clear about success - the organization's core values, the outcomes you’re aiming for and where you’re trying to go.  Make it safe for people to disagree and foster and encourage relationships across the whole company for ideas to thrive.
* Beware of your biases and create organisational habits that enable change.  Don’t expect rebels to have all the details and answers - you can’t demand certainty from the rebel’s with ideas.
* Make sure you give rebels the right work to do.  Don’t assign them to “task forces” that are not directly related to the company’s core values and goals.  Give them concrete, relevant challenges either the right resources and support.
* To effectively manage rebels, don’t simply pay lip service to ideas - either provide financial resources for implementation or make it possible for the ideas to be presented at senior leadership meetings with your full backing.
